Every *pinout* diagram has the fundamental requirement of an image to enhance with graphical additions. This prerequisite can be sizable barrier to creating the clearest diagram possible.

During *pinout* development several image create methods have been investigated. Community members have also reached out and generously provided feedback and further options to tryout. 

Documented here is a list of what was tried during *pinout* development and some community input (some tried, some on my list to try out). The intent is to revisit all option and write-up some reviews and process notes.
